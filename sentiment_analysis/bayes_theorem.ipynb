    "## Bayes Thereom\n",
    "    Bayes' theorem (AKA Bayes' law, Bayes' rule, Bayesâ€“Price theorem), named after Thomas Bayes, describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an event occuring is the count of the event, over the sum of all events.\n",
    "- The probability of all events is 1.\n",
    "- i.e. P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B occuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bayes Theorem*\n",
    "    P(A given B) = P(B given A)*P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequencies and Probability of words in a class vs the whole\n",
    "1. count up the frequency a word in a class (i.e Pos/Neg)\n",
    "2. sum the frequencies of all words in each class\n",
    "3. calculate the Probability of each word. This is the word occurance in a class over the total words in that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### laplacian smoothing\n",
    "4. if a word never occurs in a class the probability is 0. This can means you cannot compare the probabiliy of a word between classes. If you add a 1 to the numerator and the Total Words to the denominator you can avoid getting a 0.\n",
    "#### Naive Bayes Inference\n",
    "5. calculate the product of the positive probabiity of each word over the negative probability of each word in a tweet * the overall tweet pos/negative ratio. If the product is greater than 1 the overall tweet is positive. If it is less than one it is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### log prior and log likelihood\n",
    "6. taking the log of the Inference results in a split of terms. The first term is the log of the ratio of the probability of postive to negative tweets. The second term is the sum of the logs of the ratio of the pos/neg probabilities of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Naive Bayes\n",
    "1. get/annotate a dataset and clean it \n",
    "2. preprocess tweet\n",
    "    - remote stop words/stemming/tokenize sentences\n",
    "3. compute the frequencies\n",

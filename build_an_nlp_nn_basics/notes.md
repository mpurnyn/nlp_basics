use a higher dimension vector for storing the meaning of a sentence
compare these vectors.

- embedding into vectors
- build a classifier for vectors
- clustering

### Preparing Data
same as the previous step
1. download and import data
2. split data into trainign and testing
3. extract sentences and labels from training
4. tokenize sentences
5. fit on sentences
6. convert to sequences
7. pad sequences

# Approximate Nearest Neighbors

Approximate nearest neighbors does not give you the full nearest neighbors but gives you an approximation of the nearest neighbors. It usually trades off accuracy for efficiency.

Every time you approximate it you might get different "neighbors" so you may have to approximate multiple times to get all the neighbors.

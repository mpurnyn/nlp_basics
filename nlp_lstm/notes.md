### Implementing LSTM in tensorflow
tf.keras.layers.lstm(number_of_outputs_desired)
- adds lstm later
bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.lstm(number_of_outputs_desired))
- makes cell state go in both directions
Conv1D(128, 5, activation-'relu')
sequence make a large difference when determining semantics of language
because the order in which words appear dictate their impact on the meaning of the sentence
